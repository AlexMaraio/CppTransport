The CppTransport sources incorporate portions of the following open source projects:

* The GinacPrint common subexpression elimination algorithm made available by Doug Baker

License: GPL-2
This is incorporated in the source files
translator/backends/infrastructure/language_concepts/cse.cpp

The CppTransport translator and runtime system are linked to the following
libraries. The build process assumes they are available on the system,
but does not automatically install them.

The CppTransport sources do not include source code (or derivatives of the source code)
from these libraries; they only link to them as external resources.

constructed by (1) running the translator and (2) building the resulting code
using the provided runtime system.

The CppTransport sources do not include source code (or derivatives of the source code)
from these libraries. Compiled executables using the provided runtime system
