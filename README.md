# Overview

**CppTransport** is an automated platform that can be used to solve for the 2 and 3-point functions of the perturbations produced during an inflationary epoch in the very early universe. The present version is implemented for models with canonical kinetic terms, although the underlying method is quite general and can be scaled to handle models with a non-trivial field-space metric or an even more general non-canonical Lagrangian. Future versions of **CppTransport** may include support for these generalizations.

The numerical results produced by **CppTransport** are accurate to tree-level, including all quantum effects. In particular this includes

* effects generated by interference between growing and decaying modes near horizon exit
* effects generated by a nontrivial mass hierarchy, correctly accounting for modes which are heavy or light compared to the inflationary scale
* effects from trajectory bending and species correlation near horizon exit
* superhorizon evolution of the perturbations

The present version of **CppTransport** has been written by David Seery at the University of Sussex. It implements a formalism developed by Mafalda Dias, Jonathan Frazer, David Mulryne and David Seery.

A different system implementing the same formalism, but with slightly different design goals, has been developed by David Mulryne at Queen Mary, University of London. It is available from **xyz**.
