# Overview

**CppTransport** is an automated platform that can be used to solve for the 2 and 3-point functions of the perturbations produced during an inflationary epoch in the very early universe. The present version is implemented for canonical models, although the underlying method is quite general and can be scaled to handled models with a non-trivial field-space metric or even more general non-canonical Lagrangians.

The present version of **CppTransport** has been written by David Seery. It implements a formalism developed by Mafalda Dias, Jonathan Frazer, David Mulryne and David Seery.

A different system implementing the same formalism, but with slightly different design goals, has been developed by David Mulryne. It is available from **xyz**.
